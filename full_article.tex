\section{Introduction}

cclib\cite{Oboyle2008} (\url{http://cclib.github.io/} and \url{https://github.com/cclib/cclib}) is an open-source library, written in Python, for parsing and interpreting the results of computational chemistry packages.  The goals of cclib are centered around the reuse of data obtained from these programs and contained in output files, specifically:
\begin{itemize}
\item extract (parse) data from the output files generated by multiple programs,
\item provide a consistent interface to the results of computational chemistry calculations, particularly those results that are useful for algorithms or visualization,
\item facilitate the implementation of algorithms that are not specific to a particular computational chemistry package, and
\item to maximize interoperability with other open source computational chemistry and cheminformatic software libraries.
\end{itemize}

In addition to following traditional semantic versioning practices, literature-citeable versions of cclib are also available through Zenodo, from 1.2\cite{Langner2014} through 1.7\cite{Berquist2021}, with a new citation for each minor release.

Anecdotally, a random sampling of the latest citations for the original paper shows that most citations are actually for GaussSum, one of the earliest tools that integrated cclib as a core component.

\section{Open development workflow and the cclib community}

TODO say something about Open Chemistry here?

\subsection{Contributing}

The primary driving force behind each of the author's individual contributions has been the need

\cite{Berquist2017,Upadhyay2020}

\subsection{Google Summer of Code}

Since 2015 (TODO), cclib has participated in Google Summer of Code (GSoC, \url{https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/}), held between TODO and TODO each year.  Rather than be an individual organization, we apply under the Open Chemistry umbrella group, alongside Avogadro, Open Babel, DeepChem, RDKit, gnina, 3Dmol.js, NWChem, and Psi4.  Open Chemistry maintains a yearly list of project ideas, the latest iteration of which is located at \url{https://wiki.openchemistry.org/GSoC_Ideas_2020}.  cclib has gained a number of sizable contributions through GSoC which would have been time-consuming or infeasible with only the core team.

TODO put in paragraph form:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2015: did not participate
\item 2016: Support for both reading and writing CJSON (Sanjeed Schamnad)
\item 2017: Support for writing Molden and WFX files (Sagar Gaur); OpenChemVault, a framework for parsing outputs into a database and serving them with a web UI (\url{https://github.com/cclib/openchemvault}) (Nitish Garg)
\item 2018: New parsers for Molcas and Turbomole (Kunal Sharma)
\item 2019: did not participate
\item 2020: atomic partial charge methods (Minsik)
\end{itemize}

\section{Using cclib with the CLI/API interfaces}

\section{Highlighted developments in cclib 2.0}
\subsection{Parsers}

The programs currently supported along with their first version cclib ``knows'' about are ADF (since TODO), Dalton (since TODO), Firefly (since TODO), GAMESS (US) (since TODO), GAMESS-UK (since TODO), Gaussian (since TODO), Jaguar (since TODO), Molcas (since TODO), Molpro (since TODO), MOPAC (since TODO), NWChem (since TODO), ORCA (since TODO), Psi4 (since TODO), Q-Chem (since TODO), and Turbomole (since TODO).  Additionally, formatted checkpoint files (FChk or \texttt{fchk}) produced by Gaussian and Q-Chem can also be parsed, and a GAMESS \texttt{*.dat} parser has been requested.  Some programs produce even more output files by default, such as Molpro and especially Turbomole, requiring the parsing of multiple files and merging results into a single \texttt{ccData} object.

\subsection{Bridges}
    * New bridge to Atomic Simulation Environment (Felipe S. S. Schneider)
    * New bridge to PySCF (Amanda Dumi)
    * [GSOC2020] New bridge to Horton (Minsik Cho)
    * New bridge to Psi4 (Felipe S. S. Schneider)
\subsection{Methods}

    * [GSOC2020] New methods: Bader's QTAIM, Bickelhaupt, Stockholder, Hirshfeld, and DDEC6 partial charges (Minsik Cho)
    * [GSOC2020] Support reading cube files in volume method (Minsik Cho)

\subsection{Readers and writers}


\section{The future of cclib}

Despite the seemingly outdated idea of parsing human-readable text into machine-usable data,

large-scale workflows.\cite{Abbott2019,St.John2020}

TODO insert bar plot of citation counts of original paper for each year since publication

there is still a long tail of computation that is performed outside of JSON

the computational chemistry equivalent of the Protein Data Bank does not exist

like Open Babel and RDKit, which have organically grown into toolboxes covering large parts of cheminformatics space. Through its Python interface, RDKit in particular has its force fields integrated as part of QCEngine and is therefore generally available throughout the MolSSI ecosystem.
